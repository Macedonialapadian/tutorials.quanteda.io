Topics models are unsupervised document classification techniques. By modeling distributions of topics over words and words over documents, topic models identify the most discriminatory groups of documents automatically. 


```r
require(quanteda)
require(quanteda.corpora)
require(seededlda)
require(lubridate)
```


```r
corp_news <- download("data_corpus_guardian")
```



We only select news articles published in 2016 using `corpus_subset()` and the `year` function from the **lubridate** package. 


```r
corp_news_2016 <- corpus_subset(corp_news, year(date) == 2016)
ndoc(corp_news_2016)
```

```
## [1] 1959
```

Further, after removal of function words and punctuation in `dfm()`, we keep only the top 20% of the most frequent features (`min_termfreq = 0.8`) that appear in less than 10% of all documents (`max_docfreq = 0.1`) using `dfm_trim()` to focus on common but distinguishing features.


```r
toks_news <- tokens(corp_news_2016, remove_punct = TRUE, remove_numbers = TRUE, remove_symbol = TRUE)
toks_news <- tokens_remove(toks_news, pattern = c(stopwords("en"), "*-time", "updated-*", "gmt", "bst"))
dfmat_news <- dfm(toks_news) %>% 
              dfm_trim(min_termfreq = 0.8, termfreq_type = "quantile",
                       max_docfreq = 0.1, docfreq_type = "prop")
```

**quanteda** does not implement topic models, but you can fit LDA and seeded-LDA with the **seededlda** package.

### LDA

`k = 10` specifies the number of topics to be discovered. This is an important parameter and you should try a variety of values and validate the outputs of your topic models thoroughly.


```r
tmod_lda <- textmodel_lda(dfmat_news, k = 10)
```

You can extract the most important terms for each topic from the model using `terms()`.


```r
terms(tmod_lda, 10)
```

```
##       topic1       topic2          topic3     topic4     topic5    topic6     
##  [1,] "apple"      "climate"       "syria"    "officers" "clinton" "oil"      
##  [2,] "game"       "water"         "isis"     "prison"   "sanders" "markets"  
##  [3,] "google"     "energy"        "military" "black"    "cruz"    "prices"   
##  [4,] "housing"    "gas"           "islamic"  "dead"     "hillary" "sales"    
##  [5,] "customers"  "food"          "un"       "criminal" "obama"   "investors"
##  [6,] "users"      "project"       "syrian"   "father"   "trump's" "rates"    
##  [7,] "games"      "air"           "forces"   "officer"  "bernie"  "shares"   
##  [8,] "technology" "environmental" "china"    "son"      "ted"     "banks"    
##  [9,] "facebook"   "land"          "muslim"   "victims"  "rubio"   "sector"   
## [10,] "iphone"     "residents"     "peace"    "arrested" "senator" "trading"  
##       topic7       topic8     topic9       topic10    
##  [1,] "corbyn"     "refugees" "australia"  "violence" 
##  [2,] "johnson"    "brussels" "australian" "education"
##  [3,] "leadership" "talks"    "labor"      "medical"  
##  [4,] "shadow"     "french"   "turnbull"   "hospital" 
##  [5,] "jeremy"     "turkey"   "senate"     "drug"     
##  [6,] "boris"      "summit"   "budget"     "schools"  
##  [7,] "tory"       "migrants" "funding"    "nhs"      
##  [8,] "khan"       "refugee"  "coalition"  "child"    
##  [9,] "junior"     "benefits" "malcolm"    "drugs"    
## [10,] "commons"    "greece"   "review"     "girls"
```

You can then obtain the most likely topics using `topics()` and save them as a document-level variable.


```r
head(topics(tmod_lda), 20)
```

```
## text136751 text136585 text139163 text169133 text153451 text163885 text157885 
##     topic2     topic7     topic1     topic4     topic4     topic2     topic5 
## text173244 text137394 text169408 text184646 text127410 text134923 text169695 
##     topic2     topic9     topic1     topic7     topic4     topic7     topic6 
## text147917 text157535 text177078 text174393 text181782 text143323 
##     topic1     topic2     topic2     topic5    topic10     topic7 
## 10 Levels: topic1 topic2 topic3 topic4 topic5 topic6 topic7 topic8 ... topic10
```

```r
# assign topic as a new document-level variable
dfmat_news$topic <- topics(tmod_lda)

# cross-table of the topic frequency
table(dfmat_news$topic)
```

```
## 
##  topic1  topic2  topic3  topic4  topic5  topic6  topic7  topic8  topic9 topic10 
##     228     209     186     260     205     209     219      72     165     199
```

### Seeded LDA

In the seeded LDA, you can predefine topics in LDA using a dictionary of "seed" words.


```r
# load dictionary containing seed words
dict_topic <- dictionary(file = "../dictionary/topics.yml")
print(dict_topic)
```

```
## Dictionary object with 5 key entries.
## - [economy]:
##   - market*, money, bank*, stock*, bond*, industry, company, shop*
## - [politics]:
##   - lawmaker*, politician*, election*, voter*
## - [society]:
##   - police, prison*, school*, hospital*
## - [diplomacy]:
##   - ambassador*, diplomat*, embassy, treaty
## - [military]:
##   - military, soldier*, terrorist*, marine, navy, army
```

The number of topics is determined by the number of keys in the dictionary. Next, we fit the seeded LDA model using `textmodel_seededlda()` and specify the dictionary with our relevant keywords.


```r
tmod_slda <- textmodel_seededlda(dfmat_news, dictionary = dict_topic)
```

Some of the topic words are seed words, but the seeded LDA identifies many other related words.


```r
terms(tmod_slda, 20)
```

```
##       economy       politics      society     diplomacy      military   
##  [1,] "markets"     "clinton"     "hospital"  "labor"        "military" 
##  [2,] "banks"       "sanders"     "prison"    "corbyn"       "refugees" 
##  [3,] "oil"         "cruz"        "schools"   "turnbull"     "syria"    
##  [4,] "energy"      "obama"       "violence"  "johnson"      "isis"     
##  [5,] "sales"       "hillary"     "officers"  "budget"       "terrorist"
##  [6,] "prices"      "trump's"     "hospitals" "cabinet"      "army"     
##  [7,] "stock"       "bernie"      "child"     "australian"   "un"       
##  [8,] "climate"     "senator"     "cases"     "benefits"     "syrian"   
##  [9,] "sector"      "ted"         "parents"   "talks"        "turkey"   
## [10,] "food"        "rubio"       "sexual"    "brussels"     "islamic"  
## [11,] "rates"       "gun"         "abuse"     "shadow"       "aid"      
## [12,] "banking"     "politicians" "drug"      "coalition"    "forces"   
## [13,] "businesses"  "primary"     "victims"   "leadership"   "french"   
## [14,] "costs"       "race"        "facebook"  "australia"    "refugee"  
## [15,] "investors"   "elections"   "officer"   "chancellor"   "border"   
## [16,] "housing"     "candidates"  "mental"    "boris"        "peace"    
## [17,] "average"     "kasich"      "mother"    "tory"         "russian"  
## [18,] "shares"      "photograph"  "medical"   "parties"      "russia"   
## [19,] "trading"     "delegates"   "drugs"     "jeremy"       "paris"    
## [20,] "development" "supporters"  "girls"     "negotiations" "muslim"
```

`topics()` on returns dictionary keys as the most likely topics of documents.


```r
head(topics(tmod_slda), 20)
```

```

```

```r
# assign topics from seeded LDA as a document-level variable to the dfm
dfmat_news$topic2 <- topics(tmod_slda)

# cross-table of the topic frequency
table(dfmat_news$topic2)
```

```
